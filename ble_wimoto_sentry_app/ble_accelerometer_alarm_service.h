* @details This module implements the Movement Service with the movement alarm characteristic.
*          During initialization it adds the movement Service  to the BLE stack database. 
*

*
* @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the movement Service module by calling
*       ble_movement_on_ble_evt() from the from the @ref ble_stack_handler callback.
